# FinalProject-ArtificalIntelligence-CS440
Final Project Showcase in CS440 - Artificial Intelligence.

This project is essentially a combination of multiple top Kaggle Submissions for the Skin Cancer MNIST classification competition. My code/work is minimal and I mainly completed this project with the goal of learning from open source contributions. Note that I used only train and test datasets.....usual practice involves train, development, and test datasets but I stuck to train and test due to the size of the dataset.

Main Takeaways:
- Data Augmentation and Utilizing Effective Optimization Algorithms are both some of the easiest ways to improve model accuracy on image datasets. 

- It is important to pull training data and testing data both from the same dataset distribution.


TODO: In the end I did not attain accuracy anywhere near that of the top Kaggle submitters. I have not fixed the bug in my code for the reason that this project was done only to showcase my ability to find optimal hyperperameters for a model with the small amount of processing power I had available.
