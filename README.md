# FinalProject-ArtificalIntelligence-CS440
Final Project Showcase in CS440 - Artificial Intelligence.

This project is essentially a combination of multiple top Kaggle Submissions for the Skin Cancer MNIST classification competition. My code/work is minimal and I mainly completed this project with the goal of learning from open source contributions.


The dataset can be found from: https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000
